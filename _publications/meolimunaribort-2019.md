<b>Abstract</b><br><br>

Building on signaling theory, this paper analyzes whether projects signaling patented technologies have
a higher probability of funding success on a reward-based crowdfunding platform as compared with a
control group of similar projects. Our analysis of a set of Kickstarter projects suggests the existence of an
apparent paradox concerning the role of patents in this funding context. Despite solid evidence in entrepreneurial
finance literature on the positive role of patents for accessing financing from professional
investors such as venture capitals and business angels, our results from the reward-based crowdfunding
context point out a negative signaling role of patents. We provide explanations to reconcile such evidence
with previous relevant literature and highlight promising avenues for future research in this area.
